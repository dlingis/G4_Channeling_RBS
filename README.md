# G4_Channeling_RBS
RBS/C toolkit in GEANT4

The updated and modified model of amorphous materials (https://github.com/dlingis/G4_RBS_simulator) with the ability to simulate channeling (https://github.com/dlingis/G4_MC_IonBeamChanneling) RBS spectra of protons. 
The description and results obtained with the model can be found at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nimb.2023.165091.
